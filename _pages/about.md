Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at KU Leuven, Belgium, since October 2019. I received my PhD from Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, in March 2019. My research lies at the boundaries of Quantitative Marketing, Applied Econometrics and Empirical Industrial Organization.  In particular, I am interested in topics such as the impact of regulatory interventions and market disruptions on consumer choices and firm behavior. I am also interested in investigating the effect of initiatives that aim to promote sustainable consumption such as the introduction of animal welfare labels. Typically, I combine state-of-the-art econometric methods with economic models of consumer and firm behavior to examine marketing related questions.  I seek to to bridge the gap between Marketing Practice and Public Policy by assisting decision-makers with robust empirical evidence.
