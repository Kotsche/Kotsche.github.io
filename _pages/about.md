Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! I am an Assistant Professor in Marketing at KU Leuven, Belgium, since October 2019. I received my PhD from Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, in March 2019. My research lies at the boundaries of Empirical Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. In particular, I am interested in topics such as pricing, regulation, consumer choice models (frequentist as well as Bayesian approaches) and competive analysis. Typically, I combine state-of-the-art econometric methods with economic models of consumer and firm behavior to examine marketing related questions. The aim of my research is to assist decisionmakers in business and politics with  a data-driven approach.
During my doctoral studies I gained extensive experience working with consumer purchase data grocery retail sector.
