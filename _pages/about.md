Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at KU Leuven, Belgium, since October 2019. I received my PhD from Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, in March 2019. My research lies at the boundaries of Quantitative Marketing, Applied Econometrics and Empirical Industrial Organization.  In particular, I am interested in topics such as the impact of regulatory intervention on consumer choice and firm behavior. Typically, I combine state-of-the-art econometric methods with economic models of consumer and firm behavior to examine marketing related questions. I seek to to bridge the gap between Marketing practice and Public policy. The aim of my research is to assist decision-makers in business and politics with sound empirical evidence.
