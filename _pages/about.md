Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! I am a doctoral candidate at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany. My research lies at the boundaries of Empirical Industrial Organization and Quantitative Marketing. In particular, I am interested in topics such as pricing, regulation, consumer choice models, demand estimation (frequentist as well as Bayesian approaches) and competition policy. Typically, I use state-of-the-art econometric models of consumer demand and firm behavior to generate insights relevant to decision makers in business and politics.
