Using individual coffee purchase data, this paper analyzes how retailers use their store
brands to mitigate the effect of brand manufacturer wholesale price increases. This article
shows how after an asymmetric rise in wholesale prices, retailers' marginal cost of stocking
national brands increases more than those of stocking their store brand. The estimates from
a structural model of retail competition indicate that by altering their prices and margins,
retailers can divert more demand towards store brands and indeed mitigate the losses that
might have resulted if they had kept their product margins constant. As a consequence, retailers get price-sensitive customers to switch to store brands by lowering their margins.
For branded products, with a relatively larger change in marginal cost, retailers increase
their margins instead.

This paper estimates an individual level demand model for animal welfare differentiated eggs with German household data. We evaluate the effect on consumer surplus of a higher minimum quality standard for eggs in terms of animal welfare. Prices of the remaining higher quality eggs typically fall after increasing the minimum quality standard.  As a result consumer welfare is redistributed from households who do not value animal welfare  to  households that are willing to pay a premium for animal welfare. Our results show that, on average, households with higher income are willing to pay more for eggs that provide higher animal welfare. This provides evidence for a regressive impact of higher minimum quality standards. In counter-factual scenarios, we estimate the required cost reduction in order to offset the regressive effect. As pricing power increases, the cost reduction must be higher. Finally, we examine hypothetical future scenarios by successively increasing
the minimum quality standard until only the highest quality egg alternative remains on the market.
