<summary>Abstract</summary>
<sub>
Using individual coffee purchase data, this paper analyzes how retailers use their store
brands to mitigate the effect of brand manufacturer wholesale price increases. This article
shows how after an asymmetric rise in wholesale prices, retailers' marginal cost of stocking
national brands increases more than those of stocking their store brand. The estimates from
a structural model of retail competition indicate that by altering their prices and margins,
retailers can divert more demand towards store brands and indeed mitigate the losses that
might have resulted if they had kept their product margins constant. As a consequence, retailers get price-sensitive customers to switch to store brands by lowering their margins.
For branded products, with a relatively larger change in marginal cost, retailers increase
their margins instead.

This paper estimates an individual level demand model for eggs differentiated by animal welfare. Typically, after minimum quality standards for eggs are raised, the price of higher quality eggs falls. As a result, consumer welfare is redistributed from households who do not value animal welfare to households who are willing to pay a premium for animal welfare. In our analysis of German household data, we find that on average, households with higher income are willing to pay more for eggs that provide higher animal welfare. This provides evidence that higher minimum quality standards have a regressive impact. In counter-factual scenarios, we estimate the cost reduction that would be needed to offset the regressive effect, and find that as retailers' pricing power increases, the cost reduction must be higher. Finally, we consider hypothetical future scenarios that continue to increase the minimum quality standard until only the highest quality eggs remain on the market.

**_Cost Pass-Through and Vertical Contracts in  Differentiated Products Markets__**  
_Working paper available upon request_

<summary>Abstract</summary>

The degree to which changes in costs are passed on to final consumer prices is a fundamental question in economics, because it determines the effectiveness of many economic policies. The magnitude of cost pass-through depends on factors such as the shape of demand, the horizontal market structure and price rigidities. This paper analyzes how differences in vertical contracts impacts the transmission of marginal cost changes in the supply chain. In particular, I simulate consumer preferences from a mixed logit demand model and compare pass-through rates under different vertical contracts induced by three types of cost shocks: product-specific, brand-specific and market-wide cost shocks. As the shape of demand is traditionally a main determinant of cost pass-through, I include further robustness checks by varying the distributional form of heterogeneity in price sensitivity across consumers.
