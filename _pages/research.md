_An Empirical Investigation of Store Brands and their Role to Mitigate Brand Manufacturer Price Increases_  

Presented at: MaCCI 2018

<summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper analyzes how store brands enable retailers to mitigate the effect of brand manufacturer wholesale price increases. A significant rise in brand manufacturers' wholesale prices provides the necessary variation to examine the strategic role of store brands. It affects brand manufacturers' wholesale prices in a different way than those for store brand producers. As a consequence retailers' marginal costs of stocking national brands increase more than those of store brands. I study how retailers react to this asymmetric cost shock. The estimates from a structural model of retail competition indicate that through altering their prices and margins retailers divert more demand towards store brands and indeed mitigate the resulting losses compared to a scenario of keeping margins constant, albeit the extent varies across retailers.

This paper estimates an individual level demand model for animal welfare differentiated eggs with German household data. We evaluate the effect on consumer surplus of a higher minimum quality standard for eggs in terms of animal welfare. Our results show that, on average, households with higher income are willing to pay more for eggs that provide higher animal welfare. While poorer consumers are forced to buy a higher priced alternative or opt out of the market, prices for the remaining higher quality eggs typically fall after increasing the minimum quality standard. As a result consumer welfare is redistributed from low-income to high-income households. This provides evidence for a regressive impact of higher minimum quality standards. In counter-factual scenarios, we estimate the required cost reduction due to efficiency gains or, equivalently, a tailored subsidy in order to offset the regressive effect. As market power increases, the cost reduction must be higher. Finally, we examine hypothetical future scenarios by successively increasing the minimum quality standard until only the highest quality egg alternative remains on the market.
